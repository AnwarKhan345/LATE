# step1.n_to_n.py:	learning step1
# step2.n_to_1_deleteZeroInput.py	learning step2, being used
# heatmap_weights_step1.py	visualize weights, biases and activations, by loading ckpt
# scimputes.py	library

# step2.n_to_1.py	test, works, but predicts smaller mean, because of the zeros
# heatmap_weights_step2.py	underdevelopment
# step2.n_to_n.py	test, works
